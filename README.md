- Uses getBoundingClientRect() for accurate position tracking

- Implements coordinate clamping with Math.max()/Math.min()

- Accounts for ball radius in position calculations

### Goal Detection
- Virtual goal bounds calculation

- Ball center position checking

- State management to prevent score spam

### Animation System
- CSS transitions for smooth movement

- Keyframe animations for goal effects

- Cubic-bezier timing functions for natural motion
